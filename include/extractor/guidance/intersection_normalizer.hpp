/*
 * An intersection is a central part in computing guidance decisions. However the model in OSM and
 * the view we want to use in guidance are not necessarily the same thing. We have to account for
 * some models that are chosen explicitly in OSM and that don't actually describe how a human would
 * experience an intersection.
 *
 * For example, if a small pedestrian island is located at a traffic light right in the middle of a
 * road, OSM tends to model the road as two separate ways. A human would consider these two ways a
 * single road, though. In this normalizer, we try to account for these subtle differences between
 * OSM data and human perception to improve our decision base for guidance later on.
